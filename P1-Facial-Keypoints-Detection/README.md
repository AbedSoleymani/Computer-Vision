This is the result of this project, utilizing a pre-trained ResNet18 for identifying facial landmark positions.
As shown below, the outcome appears quite promising even after only 5 epochs of training.
To enhance the accuracy and maintain model generalization, you may opt to raise the number of `epochs` while selecting an appropriate `patience` value for early stopping.<br><br><br>
